        <h2 class="subHeading">What is that</h2>
        <p>
          The quantitative data and information are abstract as they describe
          things that are not physical. As a result of quantitative data and
          information being abstract, they become confusing and unusable
          therefore we must devise ways to present the quantitative data and
          information more physically and qualitatively. (Fullstory, 2022)
        </p>

        <p>
          We can represent quantitative data and information more physically and
          qualitatively by using Data visualization (Fullstory, 2022). Data
          visualization is the representation of quantitative data and
          information in a graphical context using pictorial elements such as
          Tables, charts, graphs, trees, scatter plots, diagrams, and maps
          (brush & Burns, 2020) (Li, 2020). Data visualization aids human
          cognition and provides new insights while also teaching the reader
          about said information. (Hazzard, 2015) (Li, 2020)
        </p>
        <h2 class="subHeading">
          What exactly though are we trying to reinterpret in a visual context?
          what exactly is quantitative data and information?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Data is raw unprocessed information and usually has less to no
          meaning. Data is represented as individual quantitative figures and
          numbers (Li, 2020). Information on the other hand is data that has
          been processed it’s the perception of the data that has been
          collected. Information is most often used and has meaning attached.
          (Hill, 2021)
        </p>

        <p>
          Example scenario: the English premiere league is a football
          association and league (premier league, 2022) in which teams compete
          against each other to get more points than any other team and
          therefore win the league. As a result, they must collect data such as
          top goal scorers in the league the collection of the people who scored
          the goals in the league alone is classified as data as those
          statistics on their own mean nothing but through the processing of
          that information I could determine patterns like which clubs have more
          goal scorers than the others, for example, the top goal scorers for
          the league last year had jota, mane, and salah, they all play for
          Liverpool and Liverpool finished close second it would not be a
          stretch to say that Liverpool having those players score those many
          goals were a factor in Liverpool finishing so high. The process is
          simple: collect and interpret data, gain information, present
          information, and gain insight. (premier league, 2022)
        </p>

        <h2 class="subHeading">Now, what is quantitative data?</h2>
        <p>
          Well, this is collected data that have a numerical value, this data is
          measured in numbers and counted in them too. Quantitative data answers
          questions such as how many and how much. (Fullstory, 2022)
        </p>

        <p>
          We can collect two types of data being, secondary data, and primary
          data. Secondary data is data that has already been collected you can
          use this data to help guide your research or make your data feel a
          more concrete example of secondary data might be a company database
          that contains information collected previously by the company in the
          past. Primary Data is data that you collect and can manipulate
          variables around the collection of the data. ( Formplus Blog, 2022)
        </p>

        <p>
          Cognition is primarily managed by the cerebral cortex, to process data
          and or information on its own takes a lot of effort and thinking, the
          process of this data is also quite slow and thus hard (Few, 2022)
          (Mnguni, 2014). Data visualization presents information in a way that
          our eyes can judge and understand, it lessens the processing load of
          our brain as it uses its abilities more efficiently (Few, 2022). Data
          visualization uses human visual perception to process information
          extremely fast and efficiently, we immediately require less cognition
          (i.e thinking) and therefore understand and interpret the information
          intuitively. Visual perception is controlled by the visual cortex.
          (Few, 2022) (Li, 2020) (Mnguni, 2014)
        </p>

        <p>
          To achieve this intuitive characteristic, our graphical representation
          has to be efficient accurate, and meaningful. Some guiding questions
          to ask may be as follows (Few, 2022):
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Does my representation clearly indicate the nature of the
            relationship between the values?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Does my representation represent the quantities accurately?</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Does my representation make it easy to compare the quantities?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Does my representation make it easy to see the ranked order of
            values?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Does my representation make it obvious how people should use the
            information?
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="subHeading">Data visualization in games</h2>
        <p>
          Now to understand Data visualization even further let’s look at how
          they function in games. Most if not all games at their core are about
          learning whether it be learning the game’s main mechanics or rules,
          most of the time we will be learning and using what we learned to beat
          or play the game. Data visualization provides a way to help a player
          learn and understand the game space in which they are participating.
          (Hazzard, 2015) (Meeks, 2018)
        </p>
        <p class="blogSubHeadings">Game data visualization types:</p>
        <p class="blogSubHeadings">Non-diegetic data visualizations</p>
        <p>
          Many games utilize data visualizations that are non-diegetic. These
          visualizations are generally made to not look like they belong or
          exist in the video games world. These visualizations exist to only
          communicate information to the player (Hazzard, 2015) (Meeks, 2018)
        </p>
        <h2 class="subHeading">diegetic data visualizations</h2>
        <p>
          Some games use utilize data visualizations that are diegetic. These
          visualizations are generally made to fit inside the video games world.
          These visualizations exist to assist the players moment to moment
          gameplay decisions, for example, some games color code enemies by the
          difficulty which therefore could help the player decide if they are
          equipped to engage with that enemy or not. data visualizations put
          into a diegetic form help make a game feel more immersive and make the
          visualizations less just pasted on. (Hazzard, 2015) (Meeks, 2018)
        </p>
        <h2 class="subHeading">Why have data visualization In games though?</h2>
        <p>
          Data visualization helps the brain think less as a result because the
          player is thinking less they are not only able to learn the rules of
          the game easier and faster they can have fun and not quit the game. As
          a result of needing to think, fewer players can immerse themselves
          more into the game and enter a flow state. Overall Data visualization
          helps communicate vital information to players and helps in crafting
          an amazing user experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          In conclusion, Data visualization is a key element in modern human
          information processing, it can be used in different facets of life,
          business, and sectors not covered here. The look at data visualization
          in games is just but a small piece of evidence as to how powerful of a
          tool it is and how advantageous it could be to learn it.
